Hey there! I'm Ammar—part-time coder, full-time coffee-fueled dreamer ☕.

-🏎️ Future F1 Data Wizard: Hoping to turn raw numbers into race wins. My simulations? They’d put a pit crew to shame... almost.

-🤖 Coding with ChatGPT: Think of me as the brains, and ChatGPT as my rubber duck with infinite patience. Debugging buddies for life.

-⚽ Football Fanatic: Collaborating on the pitch, but debugging my passes IRL.

-✈️ Pilot at Heart: Grounded but still navigating life’s turbulence.

-Fun fact: My code runs best at midnight—just like my caffeine addiction and ChatGPT conversations. 🌙
